This is a small project that is used for making a customised navigation bar. 
This navigation bar will include the home, about, contact, and other related 
pages. The point of this project is to help me demonstrate my abilities to 
write up a website nav bar that is appealing and functioningy, in addition,
reinforce what I already know about HTML-CSS.
